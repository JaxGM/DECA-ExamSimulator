Path Forward Notes (thx Copilot)

1. Decide on Script Style:
   - If you want to keep using classic scripts (no modules), remove all `import`/`export` from your JS files.
   - Use the global `firebase` object by including Firebase CDN scripts in your HTML before your own scripts.

2. Firebase Setup:
   - In your HTML <head>:
     <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.12.2/firebase-app.js"></script>
     <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/10.12.2/firebase-auth.js"></script>
     <script src="firebase.js"></script>
   - In firebase.js, initialize Firebase using the global object (no imports/exports).

3. Function Accessibility:
   - All functions will be global, so you can use them in HTML attributes like `onclick`, `onload`, etc.

4. If you ever want to use ES modules in the future:
   - Use `type="module"` in your script tags.
   - Use full CDN URLs for Firebase imports.
   - Attach any functions you want to call from HTML to `window`.

5. Next Steps:
   - Test your login and Firebase features with the classic setup.
   - Refactor code for clarity and remove any unused imports/exports.
   - Document any changes you make for future reference.

6. When you return:
   - Double-check that all Firebase features work as expected.
   - Continue building out authentication or other features as needed.
